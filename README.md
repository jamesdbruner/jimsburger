## Jims Burger

You can [see a demo on CodePen](http://codepen.io/jamesdbrunes/pen/Gqzdrb). Feel free to fork it and poke around.

### What is it?

Jims Burger is a [hamburger menu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_button) that is highly customizable but also just works right out of the box with some default animations and styling.

Currently still a work in progress.
